# The legend of Fady 

# Description 
In this project I created portfolio of some of my work including 2 web developement projects and 3 research projects done at the University of Toronto. Image 1 (the biggest one), is actually this current project where I showcase my web development skills, in addition to that image 2 showcases my refractoring skills where I had to refractor a client's website to maximize their SEO. 
Image 3 is a qualitative research project on mental resilence, Image 4 was a research study done on to examine the effects of isolation on athletes during th pandamic, and Image 5, is a presentation in animal locomotion and movement.
