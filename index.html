        <h2>Who is Fady Khalil?<strong></strong></h2><br><br>
        <p>Graduating from the most prestigious academic institution in Canada, the University of Toronto, I have accumulated tremendous knowledge and skills that enable me to excel in complex positions that require critical thinking, problem solving, creative thinking, and analytical discourse. I havedone a major in both Human Biology and Psychology which both complement various fields, not only in
            academic knowledge but in critical thinking skills that transverse along multiple practices.<br> Being a part of University of Toronto, the most prestigious academic institution in all of Canada  in terms of research and education in Canada has expanded my horizons in knowledge acquisition as well as incorporating that knowledge for intellectual use. Throughout my undergrad degree I have been exposed to different lab environments ranging from Biology, Chemistry, Psychology, Physics, and non-lab environments such as debates and collaborative workshops. Other than the academic material itself, the University of Toronto reconstructs the way their students think, every situation is approached with critical thinking and intellectual reasoning to achieve the greatest outcome possible. The element of critical thinking is not one that is restricted to a certain field or paradigm, rather it applies to a long range of spectrum of fields.<br>
            With a Detail oriented mindset I am able to execute necessary organized tasks in collaborative and competitive environments. My interpersonal and analytical skills are complemented by my multicultural lived experience as well as extensive persuasive communication techniques that both aid in handling a diverse multitude of tasks and handling sensitive confidential material. Through my critical thinking abilities and educated reasoning I am able to prioritize, learn new concepts, and work well in a team environment essential. Moreover, I am familiar with Rstudio, Microsoft office, google work space, and In the process of learning how to code using C-language. My skills are not limited to the ones I have mentioned above as I am constantly in a pursuit of excellence mode.
